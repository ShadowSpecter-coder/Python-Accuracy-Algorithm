# Python-Accuracy-Algorithm
 - An algorithm to test the accuracy of machine learning models

1) This machine learning model tests it's accuracy by choosing random values from the 'music.csv' file.
2) The value printed out is a float and represents the percent of accuracy. Ex: 0.5 = 50% accuracy, 1.0 = 100% accuracy
3) This algorithm can be implemented in projects having similar requirements and machine learning models requiring accuracy testing
